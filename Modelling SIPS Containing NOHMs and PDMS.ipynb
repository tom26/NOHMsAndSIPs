    "In the model developed by Ho, W.S., Hatton, T.A., Lightfoot, E.N. and Li, N.N., 1982. Batch extraction with liquid surfactant membranes: a diffusion controlled model. AIChE Journal, 28(4), pp.662-670, the flux of gas entering the material is assumed to be controlled by resistance inside a 'saturated' zone, which slowly grows as it propagates from the surface. They developed their model for a spherical particle, but it is even simpler in linear coordinates, so we'll develop that first. \n",

    "Suppose the saturated zone is of thickness $z$ (so the moving reaction front is a distance $z$ from the surface) and the physical concentration of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the *solid* PDMS phase of the SIP at the surface is $c^*$ (it turns out it's easier to base the calculations on the solid phase for this particular system.) Suppose also that the moving reaction front moves slow enough for a quasi-steady state assumption to be valid. Then the concentration gradient in the solid PDMS phase at the surface (and at all other points within the saturated zone) is given by:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "Graphically, this is because the concentration profile decreases linearly within the saturated zone under quasi-steady state conditions, as seen in the Figure below. The concentration profile is linear in the saturated zone because there is no reaction in this zone (the solvent is completely saturated with CO2), and so the CO2 is simply diffusing through this region from the surface to the moving reaction front. The 'fresh' zone, on the other side of the reaction front, is completely unreacted, and is oblivious of the reaction front moving ominously towards it.\n",

    "In Kun-Yi Lin's Thesis (Table 8-1), the diffusivity of CO2 inside several NOHMs was consistently around $2.5\\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{\\ m^2/s}$. The physical solubility of NOHMs inside NOHM-I-PE2070 appears to be around $10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mol/m^3Pa}$ (see doi: 10.1039/C1CP22631B and 10.1021/je200623b). This gives a permeability of $2.5 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$. Meanwhile, the permeability of CO2 in the PDMS will likely be around 3300 barrer (at least without the N2 present) which corresponds to $1.1\\times10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{mol/m.Pa.s}$. This is two orders of magnitude larger than the permeability in the NOHM, so the latter can be ignored, and $C_1$ may be approximated as:\n",

    "The weight-based chemical capacity of these SIPs seems to be about $5.8 \\mathrm{mol/kg}$, based on Guanhe's data. If we assume they have a specific gravity of 1 (I'm not sure this is reasonable, but couldn't find any data) this gives us a volumetric capacity of $w_0 = 5800 \\ \\mathrm{mol/m^3}$. If we also assume the PDMS has a specific gravity of 1 (probably reasonable), then this gives $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.66$ for the material investigated by Guanhe. $p_{CO2}$ was 100 000 Pa, and $L$ was 0.001 m. This gives us enough data to calculate $C_1$ and the $\\xi(t)$ using the equations above."

I suspect that more accurate information on the physical properties of the NOHM will help.

If we suppose the specific gravity of the NOHM were 1.5 instead of 1, then we'd have $\\varepsilon = 0.75$, which gives us a much better fit:"
